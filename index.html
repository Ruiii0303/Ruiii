    <h2>For you, Jajai</h2>

    <p>


    I want to try this and write you a letter before the valentines come para una ako sa lahat, jk HHAHA. Hi jajai
    the thing is, there's just no one I want to be with when this clock keeps ticking. It's you, although sometimes
    I don't know what to say and it's kinda weird kapag super random ng sasabihin ko. Ganto ba kapag wala na tayong
    matanong sa isa't isa?I Everytime, every minute, I'm finding a way kung paano ka makakausap, like the way we
    used to talk, it's just I'm missing you a little extra kapag dumadating yung mga times na ganyan. I know you
    have your doubts pa, but I know every wait has a worth especially if it's you. I'm always proud of your hardwork,
    I want to see it in my everyday life. Wether this will work or not, this will lasts for a lifetime or not, every
    moment I get to share with you is one I will treasure for all of my days. I'm just glad for your existence.
